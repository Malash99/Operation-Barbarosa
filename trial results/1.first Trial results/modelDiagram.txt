Optical Flow  Pose Parameters
(32x32x2)     (4 or 6 values)


In this architecture:

The encoder processes the 6-channel input (RGB pairs)
Features are shared between flow and pose tasks
Flow prediction is an auxiliary task that helps with feature learning
Pose is predicted from the same feature space as flow
