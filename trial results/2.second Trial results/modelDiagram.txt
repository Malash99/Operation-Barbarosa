In this architecture:

FlowNet:

Takes the 6-channel input (stacked RGB pairs)
Processes through encoder-decoder to generate optical flow field
Flow field is a complete visual representation of motion


Pose Network:

Takes the optical flow field as input (not shared features)
Processes through convolutional + dense layers
Outputs motion parameters (delta_x, delta_y, delta_z, delta_yaw, [delta_pitch, delta_roll])


Training Options:

Two-stage: Train FlowNet first, then freeze it and train Pose Network
End-to-end: Train both networks together but maintain the explicit flow representation
